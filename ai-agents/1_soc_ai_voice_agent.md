# SOC AI Voice Agent

## Purpose
The SOC AI Voice Agent is designed to answer questions about artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and governance in a controlled, business-aware manner. Its primary role is to support SOC analysts and leadership by providing clear explanations of AI-related risks, security considerations, and governance expectations.

## Agent Capabilities
The voice agent can respond to questions such as:
- “How does AI increase or reduce SOC alert fatigue?”
- “What AI risks should a SOC be concerned about?”
- “How should AI tools used by analysts be governed?”
- “What are the security considerations when deploying AI systems?”

Responses are tailored to the audience, using either technical or business-friendly language as appropriate.

## Governance & Safety Controls
To prevent misuse or over-reliance on AI:
- The agent does not provide operational commands or execute actions
- Responses are informational, not prescriptive
- High-risk or ambiguous questions prompt clarification or deferral to human experts
- All responses are designed to encourage human review and decision-making

## SOC & GRC Value
- Reduces time spent answering repetitive AI-related questions
- Improves consistency in AI risk communication
- Supports leadership education without bypassing governance

This agent demonstrates how AI can be safely integrated into SOC and GRC environments without replacing human judgment.
