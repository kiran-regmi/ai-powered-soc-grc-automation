# AI Job Search & Resume Tailoring Agent

## Purpose
This AI agent is designed to automate the job search and application preparation process for cybersecurity and GRC roles while maintaining human oversight. Its goal is to reduce manual effort, improve role alignment, and prevent uncontrolled automation.

---

## Agent Workflow Overview
The agent operates as a structured pipeline:

1. Search the web for cybersecurity, SOC, and GRC job postings
2. Analyze job descriptions and required skills
3. Score each role based on candidate fit
4. Tailor resume content to the specific role
5. Present the application package for human approval
6. Submit the application only after approval

This workflow ensures automation supports decision-making without bypassing accountability.

## Inputs
- Job search criteria (role, location, remote preference)
- Candidate resume and skills profile
- Job descriptions and requirements

---

## AI Outputs
- Ranked list of job opportunities
- Role-specific resume bullet suggestions
- Draft cover letter content (optional)

---

## Human Validation & Control
Human oversight is intentionally built into the process:

- The agent does not submit applications autonomously
- The user reviews resume changes and fit scores
- Applications are approved or rejected manually

This prevents misrepresentation, low-quality applications, and unintended submissions.

---

## Security & Ethical Considerations
- No credentials or personal data are shared without user consent
- Resume tailoring avoids false or exaggerated claims
- Automation is designed to assist, not deceive

---

## Value & Impact
- Saves time during job searches
- Improves application relevance
- Maintains ethical and accurate representation
- Demonstrates responsible AI automation

This agent shows how AI can be used to streamline workflows without sacrificing trust or control.
