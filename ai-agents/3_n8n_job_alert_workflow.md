# n8n Job Alert Automation Workflow

## Purpose
This workflow uses n8n to automate the discovery and delivery of cybersecurity, SOC, and GRC job opportunities. The goal is to reduce manual job searching while providing curated, relevant alerts to the user.

---

## Workflow Overview
The automation follows a scheduled, event-driven process:

1. Triggered on a defined schedule (e.g., daily or weekly)
2. Searches the web for cybersecurity, SOC, and GRC job postings
3. Filters results based on predefined criteria
4. Formats job details into a concise summary
5. Sends results to the user via email

---

## Key Parameters
The workflow allows customization of:
- Job role keywords (SOC Analyst, GRC Analyst, Security Analyst)
- Location and remote preferences
- Notification frequency
- Number of results per alert

---

## AI Integration
AI is used to:
- Summarize job descriptions
- Highlight key skill requirements
- Rank postings by relevance

AI assists with prioritization but does not make application decisions.

---

## Human Control & Safety
- Alerts are informational only
- No applications are submitted automatically
- The user remains in full control of follow-up actions

---

## Value
- Saves time during job searches
- Reduces noise from irrelevant postings
- Supports structured and repeatable career automation

This workflow demonstrates how low-code automation and AI can be combined responsibly to improve productivity.
