# AI Governance Policy Framework

## Purpose
This framework defines the minimum governance structure required to safely adopt and use artificial intelligence within cybersecurity, SOC, and GRC functions. It focuses on accountability, transparency, and risk management without introducing unnecessary complexity.

---

## Governance Objectives
The framework is designed to:
- Ensure responsible and secure use of AI tools
- Maintain human accountability for AI-assisted decisions
- Reduce operational, security, and compliance risks
- Support consistent and ethical AI adoption

---

## Scope
This framework applies to:
- AI tools used in SOC operations
- AI-assisted analysis and automation
- Third-party AI platforms and services
- AI used for decision support, not autonomous execution

---

## Core Governance Principles

### 1. Human Oversight
AI may assist with analysis and summarization, but final decisions must remain with humans. AI outputs should always be reviewed before action.

### 2. Purpose Limitation
AI tools must be used only for approved use cases. General-purpose AI usage without defined intent increases risk and should be avoided.

### 3. Transparency
AI-generated outputs must be identifiable as AI-assisted. Users should understand AI limitations and assumptions.

### 4. Risk-Based Use
Higher-risk AI use cases require stronger controls, validation, and approval. Not all AI usage carries the same risk.

### 5. Third-Party Accountability
AI vendors and services must be evaluated for security, data handling, and compliance risks before use.

---

## Governance Structure
- AI usage is approved by security or governance leadership
- High-risk use cases require documented review
- AI-related incidents are tracked and reviewed

---

## Outcome
This lightweight framework enables safe AI adoption while preserving flexibility, speed, and accountability.
