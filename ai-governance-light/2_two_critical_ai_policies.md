# Two Critical AI Governance Policies

This document defines two foundational AI governance policies that address the highest-risk areas of AI usage in cybersecurity, SOC, and GRC environments.

---

## Policy 1: Human Oversight & Decision Accountability Policy

### Policy Objective
To ensure that all AI-assisted activities retain clear human ownership and accountability, particularly for security, compliance, and operational decisions.

---

### Policy Statement
AI tools may be used to assist with analysis, summarization, and decision support. However, AI systems must not make final decisions or execute actions without explicit human review and approval.

---

### Policy Requirements
- AI outputs must be reviewed by a qualified human before action
- AI tools may not autonomously block users, submit applications, escalate incidents, or modify systems
- Human reviewers remain accountable for outcomes influenced by AI assistance
- AI-assisted decisions must be traceable to a human owner

---

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy may result in suspension of AI tool usage and corrective action, including retraining or access revocation.

---

## Policy 2: Approved Use & Data Protection Policy

### Policy Objective
To prevent misuse of AI tools and protect sensitive data by clearly defining approved use cases and data handling expectations.

---

### Policy Statement
AI tools may only be used for explicitly approved purposes and must not process sensitive or regulated data unless formally authorized.

---

### Policy Requirements
- Approved AI use cases must be documented
- Sensitive data (PII, credentials, confidential logs) must not be submitted to AI tools without approval
- AI tools must not be used to generate false, misleading, or exaggerated content
- Third-party AI tools must meet basic security and privacy standards before use

---

### Enforcement
Unauthorized use of AI tools or data may result in disciplinary action and loss of access to AI systems.

---

## Policy Impact
Together, these policies:
- Preserve human accountability
- Reduce AI misuse and overreach
- Protect organizational data
- Enable safe and responsible AI adoption
