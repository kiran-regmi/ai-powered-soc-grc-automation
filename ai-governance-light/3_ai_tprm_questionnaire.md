6. Does the AI system process sensitive data (PII, credentials, logs)?
7. How is customer or organizational data stored and protected?
8. Is data shared with or used to train models outside the organization?

## Risk Evaluation Guidance
Responses should be reviewed to determine:
- Level of human oversight
- Data exposure risk
- Transparency and explainability
- Incident readiness

High-risk responses may require mitigation, contractual controls, or rejection of the vendor.
