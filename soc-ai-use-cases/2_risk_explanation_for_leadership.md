# AI-Assisted Risk Explanation for Leadership (SOC & GRC Use Case)

## Problem
SOC analysts and GRC teams often struggle to communicate technical security risks to non-technical leadership. Risk explanations that rely on jargon or frameworks can lead to misunderstanding, poor prioritization, or delayed decision-making.

## AI-Assisted Workflow
AI is used to help translate technical security findings into clear, business-focused language suitable for leadership communication.

**Inputs to AI:**
- Technical incident or alert summary
- Affected systems or data types
- Potential business impact
- Known or suspected root cause

**AI Output:**
- Plain-language risk explanation
- Clear articulation of potential business impact
- High-level recommended actions without technical jargon

---

## Human Validation & Control
AI-generated explanations are reviewed before being shared with leadership.

The analyst or GRC professional:
- Verifies accuracy of the risk description
- Confirms business impact aligns with reality
- Adjusts language to reflect organizational context
- Retains responsibility for final messaging

AI assists with clarity, not decision authority.

---

## Outcome
- Improved leadership understanding of security risks
- Faster and more informed decision-making
- Reduced miscommunication between technical and non-technical stakeholders

This approach strengthens security governance by improving how risk is communicated, not just how it is detected.
